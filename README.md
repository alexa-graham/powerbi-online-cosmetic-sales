Interactive sales dashboard that tracks revenue trends, top products, and regional performance using Power BI and DAX

## Tools used:
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX

## Analysis:
The dashboard illustrates revenue trends for a cosmetics retailer - broken down in yearly timelines, product categories, geographic distributions, and payment methods.

Perfume sales account for over 80% of this retailer's revenue, so understanding trends within this product category is extremely valuable. The city of Abha has experienced a significant increase in perfume sales over the years, whereas cities like Tabuk and Buraidah have seen noticeable declines. This type of geographic breakdown can be useful for planning an advertising strategy. In terms of payment method, perfume sales have seen a steady increase in credit cards as the preferred choice. This could be indicative of an overall economic downturn in the country, but if the retailer is interested in encouraging other forms of payment, they might introduce discounts or payment plans for customers who use cash or ApplePay, respectively.
